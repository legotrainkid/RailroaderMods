# Legos Wear and Tear (Railloader Mod Loader)
Adds customizable damage to trains as them are used. Default is roughly 1% damage every 25 miles. Drag and Drop onto Railloader.exe to install.
Currently the same damage is aplied to all trains, regardless of type. I plan to add custmizable values for different car in the future though. 
Having a caboose at the end of the train will reduce damage by a configurable amount (Default is 50%). Cars not owned by the player will not take wear and tear damage.

Planned features:
 - Small chance for random damage to cars delivered to the interchange
 - (Maybe, and not for a while) Repair shops require loads of train parts in order to repair, would work similarly to the coal towers

# Lego's Catastrophic Failure Mod (Railloader Mod Loader)
When your steam engine runs out of water, it is instantly set to 0% condition. Includes setting to disable the mod.
