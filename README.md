# Legos Wear and Tear (Railloader Mod Loader)
Adds customizable damage to trains as them are used. Default is roughly 1% damage every 25 miles. Drag and Drop onto Railloader.exe to install.
Currently the same damage is aplied to all trains, regardless of type. I plan to add custmizable values for different car in the future though. 

Planned features:
 - Small chance for random damage to cars delivered to the interchange
 - Cabeese reduce/negate damage when run on the rear of a train
 - (Maybe, and not for a while) Repair shops require loads of train parts in order to repair, would work similarly to the coal towers
