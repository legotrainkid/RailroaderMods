# Legos Wear and Tear (Railloader Mod Loader)
Adds customizable damage to trains as them are used. Default is roughly 1% damage every 25 miles. Drag and Drop onto Railloader.exe to install.
Currently the same damage is aplied to all trains, regardless of type. I plan to add custmizable values for different car in the future though.
